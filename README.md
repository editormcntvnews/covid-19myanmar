# Disclaimer

This currently is a proof of concept.<br> 
Myanmar Government and Ministry of Health and Sports do not provide a complete and open dataset. <br>
A group of Myanmar young doctors committed to monitor and build a dataset of their own. <br>
The data applied here is collected by Dr. Nyein Chan Ko Ko. <br>

For better understanding of Exponential Growth, please refer to the youtube Video referred above.<br>
There are two phases to the Growth, 
  * the exponential and the flattening,<br>
  * the change from the linear assumption to the sigmoid curve, <br>
  * before and after passing the inflection point, <br>
  * the growth rate and the decay rates will be observed.
